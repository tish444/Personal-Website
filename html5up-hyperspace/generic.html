					<h1 class="major">Mancala Game (2023)</h1>
					
					<p>As part of a school project, I developed a two-phase game application. The initial phase involved implementing standard rules and creating a text-based user interface to visualize the game board. In the subsequent phase, I enhanced the project by integrating a graphical user interface (GUI) and adding interactivity, as well as incorporating an alternative set of rules for users to select.</p>
					<p> In addition to the development work, we graded other students' projects and adhered to clean code architecture principles. We utilized various resources to ensure our code was clean, legible, and well-organized. We created our own test cases to evaluate the code's performance, which was then tested against the professor's test cases. Furthermore, we had interviews with a Teaching Assistant to explain our logic. This class and project significantly contributed to building a strong foundation in effective coding practices, clear communication of logic, and overall confidence in my technical skills.</p>
